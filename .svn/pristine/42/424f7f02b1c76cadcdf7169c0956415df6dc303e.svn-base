This plugin enables HSTS header on WordPress


== Description ==

This plugin enables WordPress to send HSTS header to browser


Note: Enabling HSTS header will prevent user to open your WordPress site without https. 

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism that helps to protect websites against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking. 

It allows web servers to declare that web browsers (or other complying user agents) should interact with it using only secure HTTPS connections, and never via the insecure HTTP protocol

== Installation ==

After you've downloaded and extracted the files:

1. Upload the complete 'simple-hsts-preload' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory OR install via the plugin installer
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. And you are done!
